# RedisWithSpringBoot
using Springboot to create APIs for inserting and retrieval of hash sets in REDIS.


This is Standalone Java application using springboot and Redis where I created API to insert values into Redis and another API to retrieve the values inserted. The values inserted into Redis is Hash Set data Structure. 

# How to run:

 * We need to run as standalone java Application.
 * Make sure you install Redis on your local machine on port 6379.
 * Use Redis Desktop Manager to see your key-value pairs inserted into Redis.
